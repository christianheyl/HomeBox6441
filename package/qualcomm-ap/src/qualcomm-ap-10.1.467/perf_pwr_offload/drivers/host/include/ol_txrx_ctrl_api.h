 *  As part of the WLAN device attach, the data SW subsystem has
 *  to be attached as a component within the WLAN device.
 *  This attach allocates and initializes the physical device object
 *  used by the data SW.
 *  The data SW subsystem attach needs to happen after the target has
 *  be started, and host / target parameter negotiation has completed,
 *  since the host data SW uses some of these host/target negotiated
 *  parameters (e.g. peer ID range) during the initializations within
 *  its attach function.
 *  However, the host data SW is not allowed to send HTC messages to the
 *  target within this pdev_attach function call, since the HTC setup
 *  has not complete at this stage of initializations.  Any messaging
 *  to the target has to be done in the separate pdev_attach_target call
 *  that is invoked after HTC setup is complete.
 *

 *      argument for dynamic configuration queries
